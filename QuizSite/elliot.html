    <p> Congratulations you won the quiz, you have got by far the greatest man to have ever lived, Elliot.
      The yard boxing champion / physicist who is well known for his amazing looks, super intelligence, massive penis
      and most of all his modesty. As you got Elliot you must be a pretty big deal yourself probably a leader of men or 
      you are working on some noble prize winning research and although you may experience a slight case of erectile dysfunction
      (I mean just with the amount of blood needed to fill the thing it's not surprising ) apart from that you must be
      perfect.
